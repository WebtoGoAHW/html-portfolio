<h1>About Me</h1>

<p>I came to this country when my parents emigrated here after the second world war. 
Most of my time has been spent in Johannesburg - South Africa's largest city though I did spent a few years in Durban finishing my education at the Durban Technical College doing their Graphic Design Course.

<p>My first job was also in Durban at Lever Brothers Advertising Agency where I spent time in the various departments learning how an ad agency worked. My parents and I went back to Johannesburg where I got a job in an advertising agency.  I loved the life with its variety and excitement. 
When I got married I went with my husband to Bloemfontein.  There were no advertising agencies in the city but I fell into a job lecturing Graphic Design at the University of Bloemfontein.  This turned into a career path when we returned to Johannesburg and I have spent my working life both lecturing and practising Graphic Design.</p>

<p>The practice of Graphic Design changed radically in the eighties with the introduction of computers. In this game you never stop learning.</p>
